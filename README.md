## Intro

This is the initial version of these cookbooks. They've been developed with poetry as the python package manager and run in vscode.

This project will collect multiple "recipes" to demonstrate more advanced techniques for integrating with Ragie's RAG platform. Currently in contains:

- Dynamic Metadata Filter Generation - Using an LLM to dynamically generate a metadata filter based on query

## Next steps

- Deploy these notebooks so they can be more easily accessed
- Add more notebooks

Feel free to hop onto our Discord or email support@ragie.ai if you have any recipes you'd like to suggest.
