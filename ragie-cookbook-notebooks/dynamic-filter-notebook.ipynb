    "This notebook illustrates how to use an LLM to dynamically generate a metadata filter for a Ragie.ai retrieval. Provide a RAGIE_API_KEY and OPENAI_KEY where noted in the code. You can adjust the mock data, messages, and filter descriptions to better reflect your use case. Your examples and filter descriptions will require some amount of tuning to match your metadata taxonomy. This notebook can be useful for iteratively tweaking to get reliable results.\n"
